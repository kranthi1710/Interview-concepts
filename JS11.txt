//Debouncing

Self closing tags are also alternatively known as void tags, empty tags, singletons tags, etc. i.e these tags do not have contents and also can not have any child.
A few examples of self closing tags are <img />, <input />, <br />, <hr />, etc.

Debouncing and Throttling are used for optimizing performance of a webapp. It happens by limiting the rate of function calls.

Sometimes, we attach a function to a event listener like button, and on click of button many times, this function attached is also called many times which can affect the performance. To limit that function calls , we use these Debouncing and Throttling concepts.

Debouncing---If the difference between two key stroke events is certain delay, then only make a function call.
Throttling---If the difference between last function call and this other function call is certain delay, then only make a function call. It will ignore all the events occured between that time delay.

scenario2: We want to track the user when the user is resizing our browser. How many times a particular user resize the browser.
