[1, 2, 3].includes(3, -1); // true
includes(searchElem, fromIndex)

This scenario is validated like -array.length<=fromIndex<0, then we hae to do fromIndex+array.length(-1+3=2).So we need to consider index from back of array and once we reach that index from back, we start our search.
EX: 2nd index from back of array will be 3->0 index, 2->1st index, 1->2nd index, so search will start from 1(2nd index from back)
